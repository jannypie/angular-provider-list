# angular-provider-list

## Requirements

- Should load the data below into the existing data section on page load.
- Should have the ability to create providers that will immediately prepend to the list on submit.
- Should have the ability to remove selected providers from the list.
- Should have the ability to sort the list by any of the fields, both ascending and descending.
- Type ahead searching is a nice to have.
- Should not require a web server, and should be able to run offline.
- Last Name, First Name and Email Address are required fields.
- Match the spirit of the mock up but artistic freedom is encouraged.
- - Be prepared to discuss the design choices you make.
- All data exchanges should be in JSON format.

## Comments

- I would like to break out the views into partials, but it causes cross-domain issues when not run on a web server. This is why that code is contained in index.html.
- If time allows, I will return to add search.
